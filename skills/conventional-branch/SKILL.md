# Conventional Branch

Draft a branch name following the
[Conventional Branch](https://conventionalbranch.org/) specification, then
delegate all validation and the branch creation itself to
`conventional-git create branch`. The CLI owns every deterministic rule (type
validity, character set, segment/separator grammar, normalization); this
skill only supplies the type and description.

## Arguments

- `--ask` — show the drafted branch name and wait for approval before
  creating it.

Examples: `/conventional-branch`, `/conventional-branch --ask`.

## Format

```text
<type>/<description>
```

- **Type**: MUST be one entry from
  [branch-types.csv](references/branch-types.csv); MUST match the kind of
  work about to start.
- **Description**: MUST use only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens, and dots
  (dots only inside a version-like segment, e.g. `v1.2.0`); MUST NOT contain
  spaces, underscores, uppercase letters, or consecutive/leading/trailing
  hyphens or dots.
- Trunk branches (`main`, `master`, `develop`) are exempt from this format and
  MUST NOT be renamed by this skill.

## Context

- `current`: !`git branch --show-current`
- `status`: !`git status --porcelain`

If `current`/`status` above are empty or still show the literal `` !`...` ``
text (the agent doesn't support this injection), run
`git branch --show-current` and `git status --porcelain` yourself before
continuing.

## Instructions

1. MUST read [branch-types.csv](references/branch-types.csv) and choose the
   single type that matches the work about to start.
2. MUST summarize the intended work into one short, lowercase, hyphenated
   `description` (e.g. "add oauth login", not "Added OAuth Login").
3. MUST build and run the command below:

   ```bash
   conventional-git create branch \
     --type "<type>" \
     --description "<description>"
   ```

4. If and only if the arguments contain `--ask`, MUST render the branch name
   by running the command with `--dry-run` (an alias for the default
   printing behavior kept for forward compatibility, in case the command
   later gains side effects), present it with `AskUserQuestion`, and create
   it only on approval. Otherwise, MUST create it directly — creating
   without confirmation is the default behavior.
5. MUST print the result of `git switch -c <name>` (the branch name). If either
   the CLI or `git switch -c` exits non-zero, MUST fix the offending
   component and retry.

> NOTE: If `conventional-git` is not available, recommend the user install it
> with `uv tool install 'git+https://github.com/gajaguar/conventional-git@v0.2.1'`
> or `pipx install 'git+https://github.com/gajaguar/conventional-git@v0.2.1'`
> (the package is not published on PyPI).
