# Invoking a Claude Code skill

A skill from an installed plugin is invoked two ways.[^claude-skills][^claude-discover-plugins]

## Explicit invocation

Plugin skills are namespaced as `/<plugin>:<skill>`:

```text
/<plugin>:<skill>
```

`<skill>` is the skill's directory name under the plugin's `skills/`
folder, or the `name` in its frontmatter when one is set. `<plugin>` is
the plugin's name. Both are listed in
[`plugin-identity.md`](plugin-identity.md).[^claude-skills]

## Automatic triggering

Claude uses each skill's `description` to decide when to load the skill
automatically, so put the use case and the user phrasing that should
trigger the skill in `description`.[^claude-skills]

## Verifying the install

Any one of these confirms the plugin is installed:[^claude-discover-plugins]

* Type `/` in a session and look for the plugin's skills as `/<plugin>:<skill>`.
* Open the **Installed** tab in `/plugin`, which lists each plugin with its scope.
* Run `claude plugin list` in your shell, which prints `Version`,
  `Scope`, and `Status` for each plugin.
