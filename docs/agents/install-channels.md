# Install channels

A project that ships agent assets can be installed three ways. Pick
the channel that matches the user's agent.

| Channel             | Installs                    | Auto-update | MCP |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :---------- | :-- |
| Claude Code plugin  | Skills + plugin hooks + MCP | Opt-in      | Yes |
| `npx skills`        | Skills only                 | No          | No  |
| opencode skill tool | Skills only                 | No          | No  |

For a Claude Code plugin, auto-update is off by default for third-party
marketplaces and on for the official Anthropic marketplaces. For
`npx skills`, run `npx skills update` by hand.

## Claude Code plugin

A Claude Code plugin is the richest channel: a marketplace install
pulls the skills, runs any plugin hooks, and registers the bundled MCP
servers from `.mcp.json`. Auto-update is off by default for third-party
marketplaces; turn it on per marketplace or update by hand, as described in
[`claude-code-plugin-updates.md`](claude-code-plugin-updates.md).[^claude-discover-plugins]

## `npx skills`

The `npx skills` CLI ([vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills))
installs a repository's skills into the right per-agent path,
symlinked by default. It supports multiple agents in one command (`-a
claude-code -a opencode`), a global install (`-g`), and independent
copies instead of symlinks (`--copy`); see
[`npx-skills-install.md`](npx-skills-install.md).[^vercel-skills]

## opencode

opencode does not have a plugin marketplace. It reads skills from a
small, fixed set of paths and exposes them through the `skill` tool;
see [`opencode-skill-discovery.md`](opencode-skill-discovery.md).
For MCP, opencode reads `mcp` blocks from its own config file; see
[`opencode-mcp-config.md`](opencode-mcp-config.md).[^opencode-skills]
